# material-components-android-examples

These example apps are Android implementations of hypothetical [Material Studies](https://material.io/design/material-studies/). Each one is built using the [MDC-Android library](http://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/) and features special customizations of color, typography, and shape made with [Material Theming](https://material.io/design/material-theming/).

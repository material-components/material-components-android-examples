## Introduction
This project is an Android implementation of [Owl](https://material.io/design/material-studies/owl.html), a Material Study showcasing the possibilities of using Material Theming and Material Components for Android.

## Material Theming
Owl uses Material Theming to customize the app’s [color](https://material.io/develop/android/theming/color/), [shape](https://material.io/develop/android/theming/shape/) and [typography](https://material.io/develop/android/theming/typography/) to achieve this.

### Color

Owl has three primary colors. Each color is used to create a distinct visual theme for each section. See [colors.xml](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/color.xml) and how they are used in [default](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/theme.xml#L58-L86) and [dark](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values-night/theme.xml) themes.

### Shape

Owl defines small, medium and large shape categories for different sized components. See [shape.xml](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/shape.xml) which defines the `ShapeAppearance`s, which are then [set in the theme](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/theme.xml#L20-L23) and picked up by all components or referred to directly.

### Typography

Owl’s type scale provides the typographic variety necessary for the app content. All items in the type scale use [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) as the typeface, and make use of the variety of weights available by using Rubik Regular, Medium, and Bold. See [type.xml](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/type.xml) which defines `TextAppearance`s which are then [set in the theme](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-examples/blob/develop/Owl/app/src/main/res/values/theme.xml#L25-L38) and referred to using `?attr/textAppearance[...]` throughout.
